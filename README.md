#Shortest Path Finder - Dijkstra's Algorithm

Overview:

This is a web-based application that finds the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph using Dijkstra's Algorithm. Users can input graph data in a specified format and visualize the shortest path on a canvas.

Features:

. Accepts graph input in the form of node1-node2,weight;node1-node3,weight

. Allows users to specify the start node and end node

. Implements Dijkstra's Algorithm to compute the shortest path

. Displays the shortest path and its total distance

. Visualizes the graph and highlights the shortest path

. Error handling for invalid inputs

Technologies Used:

. HTML for the structure

. CSS for styling

. JavaScript for implementing Dijkstra's algorithm and visualization

How to Use:

. Enter Graph Data: Input the graph edges in the format A-B,4;A-C,2;B-D,5;C-D,1.

. Set Start and End Nodes: Specify the source and destination nodes.

. Find Shortest Path: Click the "Find Shortest Path" button.

. View Results: The shortest path and its distance will be displayed. The graph visualization will highlight the shortest path.

Future Improvements:

. Support for bidirectional edges

. Allow negative weights using Bellman-Ford algorithm

. Improve UI with animations
